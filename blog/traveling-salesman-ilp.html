	<!-- <h3>RESEARCH/INTERNSHIP</h3> -->
    Recently, I attended a <a href="https://minneanalytics.org/datatech-2025/"><b>Corporate Conference</b></a>, where companies in the Minneapolis area presented on Data and Analytics focused projects that they had worked on in their respective departments. One talk I attended was an Operations focused project by Best Buy that automated an existing route scheduling problem by framing it as an Integer Linear Program. It incorporated various business constraints, such as laws surrounding driver work hours and store operating hours.<br><br>

    One idea raised during the discussion was the cost savings. Although automating this process led to significant cost savings, a commercial Gurobi Solver has a high commercial license cost. A Google Search estimates around $10,000 for an annual commercial license.<br><br>

    This is quite high. I was curious to learn more of the tradeoffs among using a costly solver, using open source alternatives (e.g. SCIP), and approximating the solution at the expense of violating integrality constraints. This also seemed like a good avenue to learn about commercial versus open source software, particularly in a time when open source alternatives for fee-based software are on the rise (e.g. DeepSeek).<br><br>

    <b>Rest of the blog and PoC are coming soon.</b><br><br>
